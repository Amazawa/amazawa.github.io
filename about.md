Blockchain technology is flourishing into a wide spectrum of academic and industrial initiatives in many fields such as banking, insurance, manufacturing, supply chain, education, healthcare, government, etc. As a decentralized online ecosystem based on blockchain, Web3 has gained a lot of attention in recent years, which revolves around blockchain based technologies and applications such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organization (DAOs), and Metaverse.
